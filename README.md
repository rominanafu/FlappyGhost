# Flappy Ghost
## Description üëª
Hi! Welcome to my spooky project!<br>
Flappy Ghost is a game that is based on the famous game "Flappy Bird", but the main character is now a ghost that is trying to get through some tombs and skulls. In contrast to Flappy Bird, I added a feature where some tombs have a skull (that is also an obstacle) that goes from one to the other, adding some difficulty to the game, and the color theme changes from blue to green and vice versa every 20 points.<br>
For this project, I used the Unity game engine, as well as C# for the scripts. In order to use these tools, I previously took part of the specialization "C# Programming for Unity Game Development" in Coursera, which introduced me to Unity and C#. This gave me some panorama of how to manipulate these tools, finally leading me to develop this game.<br>
All the graphics and animations used in this game were made by myself, and it was certainly an interesting challenge.<br>
Throughout the development of this game, I received a lot of feedback of family and friends that helped me to have better animations and different features, so I really appreciate them.

The first score represents the points gained on the current game, and the second one represents the maximum score of all games since the app was opened (every time it is closed, the maximum score resets).
